        As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there isn't specific information about a "Gems founder" in Dubai. However, it's possible that you may be referring to GEMS Education, one of the largest private education providers in the world, which is based in Dubai.
        
        GEMS Education was founded by Sunny Varkey, an Indian entrepreneur, in 1959. It started as a single school in Dubai and has since grown into a global network of schools and educational services, spanning multiple countries. The organization's mission is to provide quality education to students worldwide and has played a significant role in shaping the educational landscape in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and beyond.
        
        Sunny Varkey's vision and commitment to education have led GEMS Education to become a leader in the field, with schools that offer a wide range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB), British, American, and Indian systems. GEMS schools have gained a reputation for their academic excellence and commitment to fostering well-rounded, global citizens.
        
        Please note that there may have been developments or changes related to GEMS Education and its founder since my last knowledge update in September 2021. If you require the most current information, I recommend checking the latest news and resources related to GEMS Education in Dubai.</p>
